## 🚀 Quick Features Overview

Your form now includes:

### ✅ Multiple Phone Numbers
- Add/remove phone fields dynamically
- Support for different country codes
- Smart validation on blur

### ✅ Field-Level Validation
- Real-time error messages
- Validation on blur for better UX
- Clear error indicators

### ✅ Gender Dropdown
- Clean selection interface
- Multiple options available
- Proper form integration

### ✅ Better ID Generation
- Auto-incrementing IDs (1, 2, 3...)
- Session-persistent storage
- No huge timestamp numbers

---

## 📖 Key Concepts Explained

### Arrays for Multiple Items
```tsx
// Single item
const phone = '+1 123 456 7890'

// Multiple items
const phones = ['+1 123 456 7890', '+44 20 1234 5678']
```

### Immutability (Don't modify, replace!)
```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - modifies existing array
phones.push(newPhone)

// ✅ Right - creates new array
setPhones([...phones, newPhone])
```

### Map to Render Lists
```tsx
{phones.map((phone, index) => (
  <PhoneInput key={index} value={phone} />
))}
```

### Conditional Rendering
```tsx
{phones.length > 1 && <DeleteButton />}
```
