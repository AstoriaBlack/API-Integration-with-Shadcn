## 💻 Study Strategy

### The 80/20 Rule
Don't read 100% of the code. Focus on:
- **80% time:** Core features, main patterns, key files
- **20% time:** Edge cases, utilities, tests

### Start Small
Begin with smaller projects (1-5K stars) before large ones (50K+ stars)

### Compare Approaches
Study how different projects solve the same problem

### Build as You Learn
After each project, build a small application using what you learned

### Contribute
Once comfortable, contribute to open source
